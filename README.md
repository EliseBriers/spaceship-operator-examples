# spaceship-operator-examples
How the C++20 `<=>` operator can be used to reduce overhead code.


## Building and Testing
Building requires a compiler with C++ 20 support. Most modern compilers should work. Making the file will result in the unit tests getting executed automatically.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EliseBriers/spaceship-operator-examples/
cd spaceship-operator-examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
